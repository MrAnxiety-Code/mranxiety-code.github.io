## I'm Mr Anxiety
I'm scared to post as me on the internet, realised it was making me shy IRL. So I'm trying being anonymous online to overcome that. I maintain a series of loosly connected Spreadsheets for a living, but I got back into writing code so I started a GitHub page to store it all. Also, learn how to use GitHub.
