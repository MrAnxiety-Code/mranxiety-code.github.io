# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrAnxiety-Code
I'm scared to post as me on the internet, realised it was making me shy IRL. So I'm trying being anonymous online to overcome that. I maintain a series of loosly connected Spreadsheets for a living, but I got back into writing code so I started a GitHub page to store it all. Also, learn how to use GitHub.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AT Proto, Salesforce, Spreadsheets
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript
